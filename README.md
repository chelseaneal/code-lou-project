# Horses and Hope

## Description
```
This is my capstone project for a 12-week Front End Development course through Code Louisville. I created a website for a local non-profit that my mother co-founded, to demonstrate my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

```



## Custom CSS Classes
```
The class(es) I created are:

1. class name ex( .main-info-section )
.. what class does, ex( adds padding & changes background color of .main-info-section )

2.

```



## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created are:

1. $('.dropdown-content').hide();
.. This function hides the dropdown menu in mobile format

2. $('#menu-icons').click()
.. This function toggles the dropdown menu in mobile format, and also toggles between a hamburger menu icon and exit icon

```
