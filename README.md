# Horses and Hope

## Description
```
This is my capstone project for a 12-week Front End Development course through Code Louisville. 
I created a mock-up website for a local non-profit, to demonstrate my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
```

## Instructions
```
This website can be previewed at https://chelseaneal.github.io/horses-and-hope/

It can also be cloned onto local device using git. 

Index.html is the home page.
```





## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created are:

1. $('.dropdown-content').hide();
.. This function hides the dropdown menu in mobile format

2. function handleClick() {
  $('.dropdown-content').toggle("slow");
  $(this).find('img').toggle();
}
3. $('#menu-icons').click()
.. These functions toggle the dropdown menu in mobile format, and also toggle between a hamburger menu icon and exit icon
```
